To emulate pointers, we need, at least:
1. copy constructor
2. operator= (copy) 
3. operator==, != (compare) 
4. operator* (access value) 
5. operator++ (increment)


Iterator-
Must have a class inside for both const and non-const iterators

To see a good example of the iterators classes:
	- Folder 8 -> Folder 2 -> hpp file
